*****************  ********************

"TAILS Candy" provides a set of on-demand installation/update scripts for
OpenSSH, VLC, TorChat, OnionMail, OnionShare, Tahoe LAFS, Pond, Martus,
Academic Signature, Tomb, Armory, Dropbox, SilentEye, TeamViewer, PyBitmessage,
Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, Tor Messenger (beta), Armory, Rootkit Hunter,
AIDE and Veracrypt.

Additional features:

1) Create a persistent autostart entry in ~/.config/autostart that will be
executed every time you log in to TAILS. You can customise the Customisations.sh
script it runs and which can be found in the ~/Persistent/Packages folder.

2) Disable TAILS Gnome Keyring Daemon SSH-support by overriding default
autostart. This is done by creating another ~/.config/autostart item which is
a copy of the one in /etc/xdg/autostart but with Autostart set to false.
Reason for doing so is that Gnome Keyring s*cks, doesn't support recent SSH key
types and normal people are using the GnuPG agent for this purpose anyway.

3) Check for GPG SSH-support in ~/.bashrc and ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf. Set if
not found. Check if you have configured GPG persistence.

4) Persistently modify the Gnome menu to contain an "Encryption" group menu
item ( ~/.config/menus/ and ~/.local/share/desktop-directories/Encryption.
directory )

5) Disable weak DHE-exchanges & RC4-ciphers in the user's Tor Browser default
profile.

6) Create a link to the TAILSCandy folder on the user's desktop so he/she can
perform point-and-click installations/updates.

7) Propose to replace the default Gnome top panel by a customised one
containing additional icons for system settings and to restart the panel.
(~/.config/gnome-panel/panel-default-layout.layout). Saves the original
if answered yes to.

8) Propose to make I2P settings persistent.

9) Ask if you want to make some additional Debian package installations
persistent by adding them to the live-additional-software.conf file (e.g.
Mixmaster, FileZilla, Putty).
