I - DESCRIPTION
=   ===========

"TAILS Candy" is a small software package designed for use with TAILS, The
Amnesic Incognito Live System. It is not meant to be used with any other OS and
REQUIRES a TAILS-installation with a persistent volume and Dotfiles support
configured. 
See https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html .

The package consists of a number of scripts that add additional features to 
TAILS, i.e. on-demand installations/upgrades of some useful software that does
not come with a default TAILS stock installation. Most of these scripts will
require the root password to be configured at the TAILS Greeter login screen.

None of these packages come with "TAILS Candy". They are fetched on demand
from Debian repositories, cloned/pulled from Github or downloaded from their
respective sites.

Many of the installation scripts are based on TAILS-installation instructions
or wrappers around routines already provided by the respective authors of the
packages (in order not to break stuff when they are revised or upgraded).

In addition to these scripts, "TAILS Candy" provides a couple of additional
enhancements in the form of login hooks, Gnome desktop and other modifications
to allow for further customisation. 


II - CONTENTS
==   ========

"TAILS Candy" will install two folders in the TAILS ~/Persistent folder:

- Packages  : Contains the actual installation/upgrade scripts as well as 
              subfolder called "Repo" and another one called "Settings".
              Repo will store downloaded packages for subsequent installations.
              Settings stores package configuration settings that cannot be
              moved to the Dotfiles persistent directory.
- TAILSCandy: A folder with .desktop files to execute the installation/upgrade
              scripts in Packages with a simple point-and-click.

The hooks and modifications previously mentioned will all be taken care of
by the "TAILS Candy" installer. Here's a short summary:

1) Create a persistent autostart entry in ~/.config/autostart that will be
executed every time you log in to TAILS. You can customise the Customisations.sh
script it runs and which can be found in the ~/Persistent/Packages folder.

2) Disable TAILS Gnome Keyring Daemon SSH-support by overriding default
autostart. This is done by creating another ~/.config/autostart item which is
a copy of the one in /etc/xdg/autostart but with Autostart set to false.
Reason for doing so is that Gnome Keyring s*cks, doesn't support recent SSH key
types and normal people are using the GnuPG agent for this purpose anyway.

3) Check for GPG SSH-support in ~/.bashrc and ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf. Set if
not found. Check if you have configured GPG persistence.

4) Persistently modify the Gnome menu to contain an "Encryption" group menu
item ( ~/.config/menus/ and ~/.local/share/desktop-directories/Encryption.
directory )

5) Disable weak DHE-exchanges & RC4-ciphers in the user's Tor Browser default
profile.

6) Create a link to the TAILSCandy folder on the user's desktop so he/she can
perform point-and-click installations/updates.

7) Propose to replace the default Gnome top panel by a customised one
containing additional icons for system settings and to restart the panel.
(~/.config/gnome-panel/panel-default-layout.layout). Saves the original
if answered yes to.

8) Propose to make I2P settings persistent.

9) Ask if you want to make some additional Debian package installations
persistent by adding them to the live-additional-software.conf file (e.g.
Mixmaster, FileZilla, Putty).


III - REQUIREMENTS
===   ============

1) A working TAILS 1.6 or 1.7 with persistent volume and Dotfiles support.
   "TAILS Candy" has not been tested on previous versions and you should
   upgrade anyway.
2) Root password set up at the TAILS Greeter (login) screen.
3) Some patience and a kind disposition. This is a first (alpha) release.
   Most (bash) scripts are really basic-basic and will benefit from some
   optimisation and code clean-up. This will happen over time.
   They will also most probably contain some left-over bugs here and there.


IV - (DE)INSTALLATION and UPGRADE
==   ============================

Make the install_candy.sh script executable (chmod u+x) and run from where ever 
you have uncompressed the .tar.gz distribution file. The installer will move the
Packages and TAILSCandy folders to your ~/Persistent directory, guide you
through the installation and clean up the installation directory package.
Reinstallations or upgrades can be done through the TAILS menu (Applications,
Other).
 
If you're tired of TAILS Candy, the package can be uninstalled by making the
uninstall script remove_candy.sh executable and then running it as root. It
will remove the two main folders from ~/Persistent and undo (most of) the
modifications described earlier. The uninstaller will ask you to either keep or
remove any applications previously installed through TAILS Candy. For those you
remove you will be asked whether or not to preserve their application settings
stored in ~/Persistent/Packages/Settings. If answered yes to, they will be saved
in ~/Persistent/TAILS_Candy_Saved_Settings . You're on your own to reconfigure
the preserved applications with these. Simplest way would probably be to move
that folder back to ~/Persistent/Packages/Settings .


V - CAVEATS
=   ======= 

1) None of the packages that can be installed or upgraded through TAILS Candy
should compromise TAILS security, and those requiring network access do so
over Tor (some of which need manual socks5 proxy configuration to tunnel
over localhost:9050). That said, I can in no way guarantee that this is not the
case, so any risks relating to installation and use of any package you install
through TAILS Candy are yours and yours alone.

2) At this time, TAILS Candy does NOT come with AppArmor profiles for the
additional packages it can install. Perhaps in some future release.

3) Do NOT add additional stuff just for the heck of it. Everything you
install increases the system's attack surface, so install only what you need in any given TAILS session. This goes for both the live-additional-software.conf
file (for persistent TAILS package installs) and the TAILS Candy packages. The
former also (considerably) adds to boot time.

4) The TAILS Candy scripts only guide you through installation/upgrade of the
supported packages. They don't explain you how to set them up or use them.
So if you're not familiar with them, RTFM or visit the reference URL's given
above.

5) All the usual restrictions on TAILS and Tor apply. If used correctly,
they should provide you with some increased degree of privacy, security and
anonimity - especially when compared to a stock Windows installation - but they
will not protect you from resourceful state actors or hardware-based attacks (
evil maid, compromised chips, BIOS/UEFI infestations etc.).

You can still mitigate the latter by running TAILS on older hardware stuffed
with RAM and preferably without wireless, bluetooth and sound chips. Unless you
have good reasons to use the TAILS persistence feature, running from DVD really 
is more secure too. If you know what you're doing, you can also run from DVD
and access a persistent TAILS LUKS-volume on an USB-stick or SSD card.


VI - KNOWN ISSUES
==   ============

1) If you have installed Dropbox, for mysterious reasons it loses its linking
information on every reboot and will ask you to register again. 
2) Minor issues with Tomb panel applet and system mime type registration
3) OnionShare was temporarily removed from TAILS Candy because of
incompatibilities with current TAILS version(s).


VII - COMMENTS
===   ========
All comments and suggestions are welcome. You can also drop me a note at
skylord|at|jedi|dot|be if you want your application included in this package.
Security-Anonimity-Privacy stuff only, please.



Happy TAILS'ing, stay safe and s*d the FiveEyes !
